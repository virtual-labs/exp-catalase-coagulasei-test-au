### Materials Required:

&nbsp;

#### Cultures:

• 24–48-hour tryptic soy broth cultures of bacteria

&nbsp;
 
#### Media: 
• Tryptic soy agar

&nbsp;
 
#### Reagent:
• 3% hydrogen peroxide

(Storage: -Upon receipt, store at 2-80C away from direct light. Reagents should not be used if there are signs of deterioration or if the expiration date has passed.)

&nbsp;
 
#### Equipments:
• Bunsen burner
• Inoculating loop
• Test tubes
• Test tube rack
• Microscopic slides

&nbsp;
 
### Procedure:
The test can be done by two methods.

a. Slant method

b. Slide method

#### &nbsp;
 
a. Slant Method:
 
1. Using a sterile technique, inoculate each experimental organism into its appropriately labeled tube by means of a streak inoculation.
2. Incubate all cultures for 24-48 hours at 370C
3. Allow three or four drops of the 3% hydrogen peroxide to flow over the entire surface of each slant culture.
4. Examine each culture for the presence or absence of bubbling or foaming.
